# FizzBuzz Testing

Apply everything you've learned by writing a simple FizzBuzz implementation:

## Requirements:
- Numbers divisible by 3 return "Fizz"
- Numbers divisible by 5 return "Buzz"  
- Numbers divisible by both return "FizzBuzz"
- All other numbers return the number as a string

## Challenge yourself to:
* It's okay if you write the tests after
1. Write the test first (Red)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor for clarity (Refactor)
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Apply AAA pattern consistently

## Expected test cases:
```csharp
[Fact] public void Convert_NumberDivisibleByThree_ReturnsFizz()
[Fact] public void Convert_NumberDivisibleByFive_ReturnsBuzz()
[Fact] public void Convert_NumberDivisibleByBoth_ReturnsFizzBuzz()
[Fact] public void Convert_RegularNumber_ReturnsNumberAsString()
```
